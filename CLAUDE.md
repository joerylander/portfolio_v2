# Agent Instructions

You are building a freelance web developer portfolio website. Read all documents in this folder before writing any code.

## Document index

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `01-project-overview.md` | Goals, audience, tech stack, site structure, data sources |
| `02-design-system.md` | Colours, typography, spacing, component visual rules |
| `03-astro-structure.md` | File/folder layout, page responsibilities, component list |
| `04-api-contract.md` | Laravel API endpoints and exact response shapes |
| `05-pages-content-guide.md` | Copy rules, section-by-section content for each page |
| `06-component-specs.md` | Props, layout, behaviour for every component |
| `07-api-helpers.md` | `lib/api.ts` implementation and usage patterns |

## Key principles — never violate these

1. **Client-first copy** — No tech stack names in client-facing text. Outcomes and plain language only.

2. **Zero JS by default** — Every component is `.astro` unless it genuinely requires client-side interactivity. Only `ContactForm.jsx` uses `client:load`. Everything else is static HTML.

3. **Build-time data fetching** — All API calls go in Astro frontmatter (`---` block) or `getStaticPaths()`. Never `fetch()` in the browser unless inside the React island.

4. **Design system is law** — Use the colours, fonts, and spacing from `02-design-system.md`. Do not invent new colours or font sizes. Do not use Inter, Roboto, or system fonts.

5. **API contract is fixed** — The Laravel API returns the shapes defined in `04-api-contract.md`. Do not reshape data in the frontend — render it as received.

6. **Results metrics use plain English labels** — Never render a metric label that sounds like an analytics dashboard. Write for a non-technical reader.

## Build order recommendation

1. Set up Astro project with Tailwind and Google Fonts
2. Create `src/env.d.ts` and `.env` with all variables
3. Implement `src/lib/api.ts`
4. Build `Base.astro` layout (fonts, meta, slot)
5. Build `Nav.astro` and `Footer.astro`
6. Build homepage section components (Hero, Stats, Logos, Services, Testimonial, CTA)
7. Wire up `index.astro` with API data
8. Build `ProjectCard.astro` and `FilterBar.astro`
9. Wire up `work/index.astro`
10. Build `ResultsBar.astro` and `CaseStudySidebar.astro`
11. Wire up `work/[slug].astro` with `getStaticPaths`
12. Build `ContactForm.jsx` (React island)
13. Create `src/pages/api/contact.ts`
14. Wire up `contact.astro`
15. Build `about.astro`
16. Final: test all pages, check Lighthouse score

## Assumptions

- Tailwind CSS is configured via `npx astro add tailwind`
- React integration is added via `npx astro add react` (for ContactForm only)
- Google Fonts are loaded in `Base.astro` via `<link>` tag in `<head>`
- All images from the API are absolute URLs — use them directly in `<img src={...} />`
- If an image URL is `null`, render a styled placeholder `<div>` with background `--accent-light`
- The Laravel API is running and accessible during `npm run build`

## What NOT to do

- Do not use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- Do not add animations beyond subtle CSS transitions (hover states, translateY on cards)
- Do not use any UI component library (no shadcn, no DaisyUI) — build from CSS only
- Do not add a dark mode toggle for v1
- Do not add a blog section for v1
- Do not use `client:load` on anything except `ContactForm.jsx`
- Do not hardcode project data — it must come from the API
- Do not expose `LARAVEL_API_TOKEN` to the browser under any circumstance
